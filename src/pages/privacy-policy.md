# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 17 Aug 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how MindVerse ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses and protects information when you visit **mindversedaily.vercel.app** (the "Site"). We operate a minimal, content‑only website showcasing our own Kindle e‑books. We do not run user accounts and do not sell personal data.

## 1. Information We Collect
We intentionally collect **no personally identifiable information** through forms at this time. The Site currently has:
- Static pages & e‑book preview content.
- Embedded Google AdSense script (see Section 4) which may perform automated ad‑related requests.

If you contact us manually (e.g. via email or social media), any information you submit is used solely to respond and is not stored in a marketing database.

## 2. Cookies & Local Storage
We do not set proprietary tracking cookies. Third‑party services (Google AdSense) may set cookies or use local storage when/if ads render. See their policies below. You can block third‑party cookies via your browser settings.

## 3. Log Data
The hosting platform (Vercel) may collect standard server logs (IP address, user‑agent, referrer, pages visited, timestamp) for security & performance. We only access aggregate analytics for operational insights; we do not combine logs to profile users.

## 4. Advertising (Google AdSense)
We include Google AdSense strictly for future monetization. Until the site exits rebuild, ad fill may be minimal. Google may use cookies & technologies to:
- Serve & measure ads
- Detect invalid activity

Google’s use of data: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
Your ad personalization choices: https://adssettings.google.com/

## 5. External Links
E‑book buttons link directly to Amazon product pages (no affiliate tracking). Amazon’s own privacy practices apply once you leave our Site.

## 6. Data Retention & Security
We do not maintain a user database. Any incidental communication (email) is retained only as long as needed for the conversation, then archived or deleted. Infrastructure is hosted on Vercel with industry‑standard security controls.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
Content is general‑interest nonfiction/fiction. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child provided information, contact us and we will delete it.

## 8. Future Changes (Email Subscription / Forms)
If we add an email subscription form or API endpoint later, this Policy will be updated to describe data fields, purpose, retention, opt‑out process, and legal basis (where applicable).

## 9. Your Rights (EU/EEA & Similar Jurisdictions)
Although we do not actively target the EU with localized services, if applicable you may request: access, rectification, deletion, restriction, or objection regarding any personal information you have voluntarily provided. Contact us as below; we will respond within 30 days.

## 10. Contact
For privacy inquiries or requests: privacy@mindverse.example (placeholder – replace with operational address before launch).

## 11. Changes to this Policy
We may revise this Policy to reflect content scope, legal, or technology updates. The “Last updated” date will change accordingly. Material changes will be summarized at the top of this page.

By continuing to use the Site after an update you acknowledge the revised Policy.
