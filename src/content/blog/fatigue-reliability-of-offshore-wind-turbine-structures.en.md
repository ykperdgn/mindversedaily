Discover our paper on a novel inspection strategy using fatigue modeling to transform maintenance and reduce operational risk.

Our latest technical paper examines a reliability-based inspection strategy specifically designed for offshore wind farms in European Atlantic waters. This approach leverages advanced fatigue modelling techniques-S-N curves and Fracture Mechanics (FM... [697 chars]
