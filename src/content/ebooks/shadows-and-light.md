<!-- preview-start -->
The Observatory should have collapsed decades ago. Instead it clings to the spine of the mountain like a relic that refuses its own ending—a shell of lenses, cracked brass rings and dust‑webbed journals. For the siblings who refuse to leave it, the ruin is both sanctuary and cell.

Liora keeps vigil against echoes of the past, cataloguing fluctuations in the inert stone their father died protecting. Arin stares forward, mapping futures, convinced the stone is more instrument than inheritance. Both are wrong in ways that will cost entire constellations.

When a fracture of impossible light ripples through the stone’s surface, reality’s pressure seal hisses. A dying universe has chosen its channel. And the Guardian who answers the call is not bringing salvation—only a verdict: the Anchor is destabilizing and entropy has a voice.

Whispers become coordinates. Silence becomes a ticking geometry. Choice becomes cosmology.
