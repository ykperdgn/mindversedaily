<!-- preview-start -->
Your mind is an operating system assembled by default scripts you never consciously approved. Background daemons (unquestioned beliefs, stale identity labels, inherited anxieties) allocate your cognitive RAM before you decide what matters. The result: context switching fatigue, phantom pressure, shallow focus.

Quantum Self is the architectural refactor: you treat beliefs as packages, attention as a scarce scheduling queue, habits as composable modules, emotions as diagnostic logs—not moral verdicts. Across concise modules you will:

1. Inventory and quarantine obsolete belief bundles.
2. Trace negative loop stacks and patch recursive triggers.
3. Flush emotional cache layers without suppressing signal.
4. Design a Minimal Friction Launch Routine (cold‑start protocol).
5. Implement adaptive habit versioning and rollback safeguards.
6. Build a personal Cognitive Observability Panel (metrics that matter).

The goal is not a mythical permanent flow state—it’s a resilient upgrade cycle: observe → instrument → refactor → deploy small. If you have tried motivational force and relapsed into latency, you don’t need more push—you need systematic introspective engineering.
