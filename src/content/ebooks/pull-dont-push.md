You have been trained to believe motivation is something you manufacture each morning with force: alarms, guilt scripts, micro‑rewards, motivational noise. That “push stack” works—briefly—until friction, mood dips or context shifts collapse it and you feel defective again.

This book reframes drive as an engineered field of pull. Instead of whipping yourself toward tasks, you architect conditions that magnetize execution. We deconstruct why push cycles decay (neurochemical volatility, identity dissonance, cognitive context switching) and replace them with four layered systems:

1. Noise Drain – locating hidden energy leaks (ambient notifications, micro ruminations, psychic latency) and sealing them to reclaim baseline wattage.
2. Direction Kernel – writing a directional vector (principle + horizon + near focus) instead of a fragile to‑do heap.
3. Emotional Transduction – converting aversion, anxiety and boredom into diagnostic telemetry rather than self‑judgment loops.
4. Gravity Engine – ritual choreography + feedback cadences that auto‑reseed momentum before stall points emerge.

Inside you’ll map “friction signatures,” design a Minimum Viable Morning, implement micro‑closure batching, and build a personal Drive Dashboard that self‑corrects without drama. Each module ends with calibration prompts and a lightweight metric to prevent relapse into push theatrics.

If you are exhausted from white‑knuckling productivity, the shift isn’t more force—it’s better architecture. Begin the migration.
