Step into a literary journey where past and future intertwine, reality dissolves, and emotions and thoughts merge. "From Broken Wings to Endless Meridians" invites you to explore the depths of your own mind through poetic language, experimental structure, and a narrative that blurs the boundaries between chaos and flow.

This book is for readers seeking:
- A unique, non-traditional narrative experience
- Reflections on healing, wholeness, and the search for meaning
- Inspiration to embrace your own scars and transform adversity into growth
- A meditative, immersive reading that lingers long after the last page

Let this work be your companion on the path from fragmentation to awareness, from brokenness to the endless meridians of possibility.
