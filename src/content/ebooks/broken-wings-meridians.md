“From Broken Wings to Endless Meridians” offers a journey woven with stream of consciousness, inner monologues, and fractures in time. The book draws the reader into the depths of their own mind, presenting an experience where past and future intertwine, reality dissolves, and emotions and thoughts merge. As the story explores the inner world of a being who begins fragmented and alienated, consciousness gradually dissolves into the universe; chaos transforms into flow, and ultimately, the narrative completes with a sense of awareness and wholeness. Far from classical narrative forms, this work promises an inner journey that is both thought-provoking and deeply felt, with its poetic and experimental structure.
